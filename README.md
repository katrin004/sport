Badminton is an Olympic sport in which two players or two teams of two compete against each other. Badminton is one of the most energy-intensive sports. The goal of each player (or team) is to throw the racket over the steering wheel to the opponent's side so that the opponent cannot deflect it. In order for a point to be scored, the steering wheel must touch the opponent's court
